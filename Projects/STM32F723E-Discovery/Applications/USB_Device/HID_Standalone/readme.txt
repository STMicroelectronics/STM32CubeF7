@par Application Description 

Use of the USB device application based on the Human Interface (HID).

This is a typical application on how to use the STM32F723xx USB OTG Device peripheral where the STM32 MCU is
enumerated as a HID device using the native PC Host HID driver to which the STM32F723E-Discovery
board is connected, in order to emulate the mouse joystick by moving the host mouse pointer horizontally.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset all the peripherals,
initialize the Flash interface and the systick. The user is provided with the SystemClock_Config()
function to configure the system clock (SYSCLK) to run at 216 MHz. The Full Speed (FS) USB module uses
internally a 48-MHz clock which is coming from the main PLL.

This application supports remote wakeup (which is the ability of a USB device to bring a suspended bus back
to the active condition), and the USER button is used as the remote wakeup source. 
   
By default, in Windows powered PC the Power Management feature of USB mouse devices is turned off.
This setting is different from classic PS/2 computer functionality. Therefore, to enable the Wake from 
standby option, user must manually turn on the Power Management feature for the USB mouse.

To manually enable the wake from standby option for the USB mouse, proceed as follows: 
 - Start "Device Manager",
 - Select "Mice and other pointing devices",
 - Select the "HID-compliant mouse" device (make sure that PID &VID are equal to 0x5710 & 0x0483 respectively) 
 - Right click and select "Properties", 
 - Select "Power Management" tab,
 - Finally click to select "Allow this device to wake the computer" check box.
 
In this application the cursor is moving forward and backward when pressing the USER button.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.
      
For more details about the STM32Cube USB Device library, please refer to UM1734 
"STM32Cube USB Device library".
      

@par USB Library Configuration

To select the appropriate USB Core to work with, user must add the following macro defines within the
compiler preprocessor (already done in the preconfigured projects provided with this application):
      - "USE_USB_HS" when using USB High Speed (HS) Core
      - "USE_USB_FS" when using USB Full Speed (FS) Core


@par Keywords

Connectivity, USB_Device, USB, HID, Full Speed, High Speed, Joystick, Mouse, Power Management

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32F723xx devices.
    
  - This application has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F723E-Discovery Rev.C 
    boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32F723E-Discovery Set-up
    - Connect the STM32F723E-Discovery board to the PC through 'USB micro A-Male 
      to A-Male' cable to the connector:
      - CN19 : to use USB High Speed (HS) 
      - CN18: to use USB Full Speed (FS)

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - In the workspace toolbar select the project configuration:
   - STM32F723E-DISCOVERY_USBH-HS: to configure the project for STM32F723xx devices using USB OTG HS peripheral
   - STM32F723E-DISCOVERY_USBH-FS: to configure the project for STM32F723xx devices using USB OTG FS peripheral
 - Run the application
