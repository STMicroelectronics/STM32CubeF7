@par Example Description 

How to configure the system to measure the current consumption in different 
low-power modes.

The Low Power modes are:
  - Sleep Mode
  - STOP mode with RTC
  - STANDBY mode without RTC and BKPSRAM
  - STANDBY mode with RTC
  - STANDBY mode with RTC and BKPSRAM
  
To run this example, user has to follow the following steps:
 1. Select the Low power modes to be measured by uncommenting the corresponding
    line inside the stm32f7xx_lp_modes.h file.
    @code
       /*#define SLEEP_MODE*/
       /*#define STOP_MODE*/
       /*#define STANDBY_MODE*/
       #define STANDBY_RTC_MODE
       /*#define STANDBY_BKPSRAM_MODE*/
    @endcode       

 2. Use an external amperemeter to measure the IDD current. 

 3. This example can not be used in DEBUG mode,this is due to the fact that the 
    Cortex-M7 core is no longer clocked during low power mode so debugging 
    features are disabled

Here below a detailed description of the example code:

  @verbatim

 1. After reset, the program waits for USER button connected to the PA.0 to be 
    pressed - LED Green (LED1) is blinking slowly - to enter the selected low power mode.
     - When the RTC is not used in the low power mode configuration, press
       again the Key button to exit the low power mode.

     - When the RTC is used, the wakeup from low power mode is automatically 
       generated by the RTC (after 20s).
     
  2. After exit from SLEEP or STOP Low power mode the LED 1 is turned ON for 2 seconds. 
     After exit from STANDBY mode, the program is reset so it restarts from step 1.
  3. The sequence will be repeated from step 1

 2. Low power modes description:

    - Sleep Mode
    ============  
            - System Running at PLL (216MHz)
            - Flash 5 wait state
            - Instruction and Data caches ON
            - Prefetch OFF       
            - Code running from Internal FLASH
            - All peripherals disabled.
            - Wakeup using EXTI Line (USER Button on PA.0 pin)

    - STOP Mode
    ===========
            - RTC Clocked by LSI
            - Regulator in LP mode
            - HSI, HSE OFF and LSI if not used as RTC Clock source
            - No IWDG
            - FLASH in deep power down mode
            - Automatic Wakeup using RTC clocked by LSI (after ~20s)

    - STANDBY Mode
    ==============
            - Backup SRAM and RTC OFF
            - IWDG and LSI OFF
            - Wakeup using WakeUp Pin (USER Button on PA.0 pin) 
                        
    - STANDBY Mode with RTC clocked by LSI 
    ==========================================
            - RTC Clocked by LSI
            - IWDG OFF and LSI OFF  if not used as RTC Clock source
            - Backup SRAM OFF
            - Automatic Wakeup using RTC clocked by LSI (after ~20s)

    - STANDBY Mode with backup SRAM ON
    ======================================================
           - RTC Clocked by LSI
           - IWDG OFF and LSI OFF  if not used as RTC Clock source
           - Backup SRAM ON
           - Automatic Wakeup using RTC clocked by LSI (after ~20s)

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.
      
@note On the STM32F769I-Discovery board, an extra current consumption(~1mA) is added due to the Ethernet 
      and USB PHYs. So, to reach the correct current consumption values, this example configures the Ethernet
      and USB PHYs in Low power mode.

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F767xx/STM32F769xx/STM32F777xx/STM32F779xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F769I-Discovery RevB
    boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.
    
  - STM32F769I-Discovery RevB Set-up
    - Use LED1 connected to PJ13 pin.
      * LED1 blinks rapidly if initialization fails or other error occurs.
      * LED1 blinks slowly waiting for user to launch test, then be turned OFF.
      * LED1 will be ON while executing EXTI callback in any mode but 
      standby one.
      * LED1 will be ON while executing RTC wakeup callback in any mode but 
      standby one.
      * LED1 will be ON while returning from STANDBY mode (PWR flag check callback) 
      * LED1 blinks slowly at the end of test.
    - Use USER Button connected to PA.0 pin.
    - Unsolder R109 resistor (0 ohm) and connect an amperemeter to the pads of this resistor to measure the IDD current
