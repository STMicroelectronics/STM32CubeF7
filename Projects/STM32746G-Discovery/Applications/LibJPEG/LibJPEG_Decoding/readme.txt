@par Application Description

This application demonstrates how to read jpeg file from SDCard memory, decode it 
and display the final BMP image on the LCD.

The JPEG images should be copied at the micro SD card root.

The images must have the following properties:
 - named as "image.jpg"
 - 320*240 size

The image size can be modified by changing IMAGE_WIDTH and IMAGE_HEIGHT defines 
in "main.h" file to decode other resolution than 320x240.

Uncomment "SWAP_RB" define in "main.h" file if the displayed image color 
are inverted

The image transferring to the LCD_FRAME_BUFFER can be done in two ways; 
with CPU or with DMA2D. In main.h file, uncomment "USE_DMA2D" define for DMA2D   
transfer. Otherwise, transfer is made by CPU.
   
@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@note The STM32F7xx devices can reach a maximum clock frequency of 216MHz but as this application uses SDRAM,
      the system clock is limited to 200MHz. Indeed proper functioning of the SDRAM is only guaranteed 
      at a maximum system clock frequency of 200MHz.

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F756xx/STM32F746xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32746G-DISCOVERY
    boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.
    
  - STM32746G-DISCOVERY Set-up
    - Connect a uSD Card to the MSD connector (CN3).


@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the application
