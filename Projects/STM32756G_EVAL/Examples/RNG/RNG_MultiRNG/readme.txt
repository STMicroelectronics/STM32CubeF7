@par Example Description 

Configuration of the RNG using the HAL API. This example uses the RNG to generate 32-bit long random numbers.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
clock (SYSCLK) to run at 216 MHz.

The RNG peripheral configuration is ensured by the HAL_RNG_Init() function.
This later is calling the HAL_RNG_MspInit()function which core is implementing
the configuration of the needed RNG resources according to the used hardware (CLOCK, 
GPIO, DMA and NVIC). You may update this function to change RNG configuration.

After startup, user is asked to press Tamper push-button.
Multiple Random 32bit numbers are genrerated as soon as the button is pressed.
The Random numbers are updated and displayed on the debugger in aRandom32bit variable.

LED3 will turn ON, if any error is occurred.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F756xx/STM32F746xx devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM327x6G-EVAL board revB and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
