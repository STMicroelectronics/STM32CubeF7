@par Example Description

Configuration of GPIO and USART peripherals to send characters 
asynchronously to an HyperTerminal (PC) in Polling mode. If the transfer could not 
be complete within the allocated time, a timeout allows to exit from the sequence 
with timeout error. This example is based on STM32F7xx USART LL API. 
The peripheral initialization uses LL unitary service functions for optimization purposes (performance and size).

USART Peripheral is configured in asynchronous mode (115200 bauds, 8 data bit, 1 start bit, 1 stop bit, no parity).
No HW flow control is used.
GPIO associated to User push-button is linked with EXTI. 
Virtual Com port feature of STLINK could be used for UART communication between board and PC.

Example execution:
On press on push button , first character of buffer to be transmitted is written into USART Transmit Data Register (TDR) 
Program then starts polling on USART TXE flag before sending next character.
On last character, program polls on TC flag to ensure transmit of last character is completed.
At completion of Tx Buffer sending, LED1 is turned On.
In case of errors, LED1 is blinking (1sec period).

Program is written so that, any new press on User push-button will lead to new transmission of complete buffer.

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F767xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-F767ZI board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - NUCLEO-F767ZI Set-up
    In order to select use of Virtual Com port feature of STLINK for connection between NUCLEO-F767ZI and PC,
    User has to set USE_VCP_CONNECTION define to 1 in main.h file.
    If so, please ensure that USART communication between the target MCU and ST-LINK MCU is properly enabled 
    on HW board in order to support Virtual Com Port (Default HW SB configuration allows use of VCP)

    If VCP is not used (USE_VCP_CONNECTION define set to 0 in main.h file), Connect USART1 TX/RX 
    to respectively RX and TX pins of PC UART (could be done through a USB to UART adapter) :
    - Connect STM32 MCU board USART1 TX pin (GPIO PA.09 connected to pin 21 of CN12 connector)
      to PC COM port RX signal
    - Connect STM32 MCU board USART1 RX pin (GPIO PA.10 connected to pin 33 of CN12 connector)
      to PC COM port TX signal
    - Connect STM32 MCU board GND to PC COM port GND signal

  - Launch serial communication SW on PC (as HyperTerminal or TeraTerm) with proper configuration 
    (115200 bauds, 8 bits data, 1 stop bit, no parity, no HW flow control). 
    Port should be selected according to USE_VCP_CONNECTION value.

  - Launch the program. Press on User push button on board to initiate data transfer.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
