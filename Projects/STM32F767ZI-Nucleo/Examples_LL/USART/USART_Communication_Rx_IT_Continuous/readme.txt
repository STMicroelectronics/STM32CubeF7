@par Example Description

Configuration of GPIO and USART peripherals to continuously receive 
characters from an HyperTerminal (PC) in Asynchronous mode using an interrupt. The peripheral initialization 
uses LL unitary service functions for optimization purposes (performance and size).

USART Peripheral is configured in asynchronous mode (115200 bauds, 8 data bit, 1 start bit, 1 stop bit, no parity).
No HW flow control is used.
GPIO associated to User push-button is linked with EXTI. 

Example execution:
After startup from reset and system configuration, LED1 is blinking quickly.
On press on push button, USART RX Not Empty interrupt is enabled.
When character is received on USART Rx line, a RXNE interrupt occurs. 
Received data is read from USART RDR register and stored in user buffer.
A double buffer is available for received data, allowing continuous reception.
User could process data received in Buffer A, while buffer B is used for reception. 
When buffer B is full, it could be handled by user, while buffer A becomes active buffer for next reception, and so on.
Each time a reception buffer is full, user data process callback is called.
Data processing consists in echoing data buffer content on PC Com port, and making LED1 toggle.
In case of errors, LED1 is blinking.

Virtual Com port feature of STLINK could be used for UART communication between board and PC.

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F767xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-F767ZI board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - NUCLEO-F767ZI Set-up
    In order to select use of Virtual Com port feature of STLINK for connection between NUCLEO-F767ZI and PC,
    User has to set USE_VCP_CONNECTION define to 1 in main.h file.
    If so, please ensure that USART communication between the target MCU and ST-LINK MCU is properly enabled 
    on HW board in order to support Virtual Com Port (Default HW SB configuration allows use of VCP)

    If VCP is not used (USE_VCP_CONNECTION define set to 0 in main.h file), Connect USART1 TX/RX 
    to respectively RX and TX pins of PC UART (could be done through a USB to UART adapter) :
    - Connect STM32 MCU board USART1 TX pin (GPIO PA.09 connected to pin 21 of CN12 connector)
      to PC COM port RX signal
    - Connect STM32 MCU board USART1 RX pin (GPIO PA.10 connected to pin 33 of CN12 connector)
      to PC COM port TX signal
    - Connect STM32 MCU board GND to PC COM port GND signal

  - Launch serial communication SW on PC (as HyperTerminal or TeraTerm) with proper configuration 
    (115200 bauds, 8 bits data, 1 stop bit, no parity, no HW flow control).
    Port should be selected according to USE_VCP_CONNECTION value.

  - Launch the program. Enter characters on PC communication SW side.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
