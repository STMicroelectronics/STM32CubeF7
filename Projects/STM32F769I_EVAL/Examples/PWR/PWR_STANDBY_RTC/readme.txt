@par Example Description 

How to enter the Standby mode and wake-up from this mode by using an external 
reset or the RTC wakeup timer.

In the associated software, the system clock is set to 216 MHz and the SysTick is 
programmed to generate an interrupt each 1 ms.
The Low Speed Internal (LSI) clock is used as RTC clock source by default.
EXTI_Line20 is internally connected to the RTC Wakeup event.

The system automatically enters STANDBY mode 5 sec. after start-up. The RTC wake-up 
is configured to generate an interrupt on rising edge about 33 sec. afterwards.
Current consumption in STANDBY mode with RTC feature enabled can be measured during that time.
More than half a minute is chosen to ensure current convergence to its lowest operating point.

After wake-up from STANDBY mode, program execution restarts in the same way as after
a software RESET.

Two leds LED1 and LED2 are used to monitor the system state as following:
 - LED2 ON: configuration failed (system will go to an infinite loop)
 - LED1 toggling: system in RUN mode
 - LED1 off : system in STANDBY mode

These steps are repeated in an infinite loop.
 
@note This example can not be used in DEBUG mode due to the fact 
      that the Cortex-M7 core is no longer clocked during low power mode 
       so debugging features are disabled.

@note Care must be taken when HAL_RCCEx_PeriphCLKConfig() is used to select 
      the RTC clock source; in this case the Backup domain will be reset in  
      order to modify the RTC Clock source, as consequence RTC registers (including 
      the backup registers) and RCC_CSR register are set to their reset values.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F769xx/STM32F779xx/STM32F777xx/STM32F767xx devices

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F769I-EVAL
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32F769I-EVAL Set-up :
    - Use LED1 and LED2 connected respectively to PI15 and PJ0 pins

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
