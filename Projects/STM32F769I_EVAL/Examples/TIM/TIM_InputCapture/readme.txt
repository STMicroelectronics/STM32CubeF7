@par Example Description 

Use of the TIM peripheral to measure an external signal frequency.

  The TIM1CLK frequency is set to SystemCoreClock (Hz), the Prescaler is 0,
  so the TIM1 counter clock is SystemCoreClock (Hz).
  SystemCoreClock is set to 216 MHz for STM32F767xx/STM32F769xx/STM32F777xx/STM32F779xx Devices.

  TIM1 is configured in Input Capture Mode: the external signal is connected to 
  TIM1 Channel2 used as input pin.
  To measure the frequency we use the TIM1 CC2 interrupt request, so in the 
  TIM1_CC_IRQHandler routine, the frequency of the external signal is computed.

  The "uwFrequency" variable contains the external signal frequency:
  uwFrequency = TIM1 counter clock / uwDiffCapture (Hz),
  where "uwDiffCapture" is the difference between two consecutive TIM1 captures.


  The minimum frequency value to measure is TIM1 counter clock / CCR MAX
                                              = 216 MHz / 65535

  Due to TIM1_CC_IRQHandler processing time (around 5.25us), the maximum
  frequency value to measure is around 400kHz.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F767xx/STM32F769xx/STM32F777xx/STM32F779xx devices.
  - In this example, the clock is set to 216 MHz.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F769I-EVAL
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.      

  - STM32F769I-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect the external signal to measure to the TIM1 CH2 pin (PA.09Pin 43 of CN6 connector).

@par How to use it ?
